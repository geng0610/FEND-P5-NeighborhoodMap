# FEND-P5-NeighborhoodMap
Created for the Neighborhood Map Project for project 5 of Udacity's Frontend Nano Degree.
This app looks at my recent swarm check-ins.

A JSON model from swarm was downloaded before the app is initialized. User's history can only be accessed post server-side authentication, so this simulate the authentication process.
We use the raw JSON file to initiate our own model.

To Start.
- Open Index.html. Enjoy!

The app does 4 things.
1. Display all recent locations where I checked-in.
2. Allow user to search locations based on name, category, and address.
3. Allow user to zoom onto a location by clicking the name of the location, address of the location, and location marker on the map.
4. Display additional details, such as images when the user click on the name or location marker.
